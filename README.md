## Introduction

Personally speaking, I'm **NOT** a C programmer.  

I started off learning programming by using the BASIC programming language, instead.  

Thus, I'm merely just a **beginner** who's *new* to learning C.  

The FREE code editor I'm using is called: CodeBlocks.

UPDATED(260224)  

I'm no longer using Windows OS Platform, anymore.  
My current OS is Linux Mint.  
I am able to create/run C code using GCC compiler.  
-(**NOTE**: I still remain a total 'beginner' when it comes to writing c code.)-
